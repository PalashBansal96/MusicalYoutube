# MusicalYoutube
A Youtube PIP player for Android.

An innovative Android app that plays Youtube videos in a small always on top player, which can be dragged around on the screen. 
The app also supports a real-time playlist queue control, in which videos/music can be added from youtube search.

If you find a bug or would like to suggest some feature, create an issue or send a pull request.

This app was made as a fun project over a weekend.
